1)Logic gate: a logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function.  
逻辑门是实现布尔函数的理想化或物理设备。

2)Boolean algebra: is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively.  
是代数的分支，其中变量的值是真值true和false，通常分别表示1和0。

How many bits information does a SR latch store?  
2个位

1) Give the three representations of an AND gate and say in your words what AND means.   
如果AND与门的两个输入值均为1，则输出为1；否则，输出为0。
2) Give the three representations of an XOR gate and say in your words what XOR means.  
如果异或门的两个输入相同，则异或门产生0，否则为1。
3) Draw a circuit diagram corresponding to the following Boolean expression: (A + B)(B + C)

4) Show the behavior of the following circuit with a truth table:
A'⊕(A*B)
5) What is circuit equivalence? Use truth table to prove the following formula. (AB)’ = A’ + B’

7) Logical binary operations can be used to modify bit pattern. Such as  
(X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2= (0000X4X3X2X1)2   
We called that (00001111)2 is a mask which only makes low 4 bits to work. Fill the follow expression   

(1)  (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 or (00001111)2 = (11111111)2  

(2)  (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 xor (00001111)2 = (11110000)2   

(3)  ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and(11110000)2 ) or  (not (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2)  =  (00001111)2
